# Automatic Titration

Worked under professor Gopi Ragupathy in his PRP chemistry lab to automate titeration using openCV and to deploy it on a open source embedded micro-controller called raspberry pi and then later we deployed the image processing based on HSV on jetson nano 2gb variant GPU for better performance.

- Download the video title `June 25, 2021.mp4` as this is the sample video used for titeration level detection
- To run the code please use the command below
```
python3 testing_frames.py -s file -f "/home/<username>/Downloads/June 25, 2021.mp4"
```
